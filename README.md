# Inspiration
Among Us Working at mcdonalds

# What it does
Processes fast food style mechanics and a killing mechanic

# How we built it
HTML, CSS, and JS. No libraries

# Challenges we ran into
Bugs that we couldn't find because JS wouldn't tell us. The scope of our app. We should have been less ambitious. Time management: we should have been quicker

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating a game from scratch with no libraries.

# What we learned
How to make webgames with HTML canvas

# What's next for Evil Fast Food Restaurant Simulator (in a city)
Full game logic: completing orders, failing if not reaching kill quota or not finishing an order quick enough, moving onto a new day with a more difficult quota Better NPC system: proper pathfinding, random trips to a bathroom Finish map: add more textures for different rooms, add bathroom Open world: add a small city surrounding it where you can drive cars and spend money after the shift Multiplayer
